This program is a basic and experimental TV series player, for my personal use : do not expect a bug-free working out of the box program

It uses mplayer as video player.

Programming languages : a mix of bash (started as bash script) and python

Configuration : needs a ~/.play_season file with at least
BASE=[base directory] # /myhome/Desktop/tv/ in my case

Seasons must be in $BASE/[Serie name]/season {1,2,...}/ directories.

python dependancies (debian packages) : python-decorators, python-lxml
